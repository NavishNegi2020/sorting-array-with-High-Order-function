# Sorting an array of element using high order function:

arr = [5,3,8,6,2,7,4,1]

#sorting the array in ascending order:
ascending = sorted(arr,key = lambda x:x)
print("Ascending order:",ascending)

#sorting the array in descending order:
descending = sorted(arr,key = lambda x:x,reverse = True)
print("Descending order:",descending)

#explanations:

#high order function:
#sorted() takes a function (lambda x: x) as a key, which defines how to sort elements. The original list remains unchanged.

#Lambda function:
#In this example, lambda x: x returns the element itself, which is used as the basis for sorting.
